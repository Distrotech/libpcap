Applications include\r\nnetwork statistics collection, security monitoring, network debugging,\r\netc.  Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface\r\nfor packet capture, and since we've developed several tools that\r\nrequire this functionality, we've created this system-independent API\r\nto ease in porting and to alleviate the need for several\r\nsystem-dependent packet capture modules in each application.\r\n\r\nFor some platforms there are README.{system} files that discuss issues\r\nwith the OS's interface for packet capture on those platforms, such as\r\nhow to enable support for that interface in the OS, if it's not built in\r\nby default.\r\n\r\nThe libpcap interface supports a filtering mechanism based on the\r\narchitecture in the BSD packet filter.  BPF is described in the 1993\r\nWinter Usenix paper ``The BSD Packet Filter: A New Architecture for\r\nUser-level Packet Capture''.  A compressed PostScript version can be\r\nfound at\r\n\r\n\tftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.Z\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.Z\r\n\r\nand a gzipped version can be found at\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.gz\r\n\r\nA PDF version can be found at\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf\r\n\r\nAlthough most packet capture interfaces support in-kernel filtering,\r\nlibpcap utilizes in-kernel filtering only for the BPF interface.\r\nOn systems that don't have BPF, all packets are read into user-space\r\nand the BPF filters are evaluated in the libpcap library, incurring\r\nadded overhead (especially, for selective filters).  Ideally, libpcap\r\nwould translate BPF filters into a filter program that is compatible\r\nwith the underlying kernel subsystem, but this is not yet implemented.\r\n\r\nBPF is standard in 4.4BSD, BSD/OS, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly\r\nBSD, and Mac OS X; an older, modified and undocumented version is\r\nstandard in AIX.  {DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, Tru64 UNIX} uses the\r\npacketfilter interface but has been extended to accept BPF filters\r\n(which libpcap utilizes).  Also, you can add BPF filter support to\r\nUltrix using the kernel source and/or object patches available in:\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.tcpdump.org/other/bpfext42.tar.Z\r\n\r\nLinux, in the 2.2 kernel and later kernels, has a \"Socket Filter\"\r\nmechanism that accepts BPF filters; see the README.linux file for\r\ninformation on configuring that option.\r\n\r\nNote to Linux distributions and *BSD systems that include libpcap:\r\n\r\nThere's now a rule to make a shared library, which should work on Linux \r\nand *BSD, among other platforms.\r\n\r\nIt sets the soname of the library to \"libpcap.so.1\"; this is what it \r\nshould be, *NOT* libpcap.so.1.x or libpcap.so.1.x.y or something such as \r\nthat.\r\n\r\nWe've been maintaining binary compatibility between libpcap releases for \r\nquite a while; there's no reason to tie a binary linked with libpcap to \r\na particular release of libpcap.\r\n\r\nProblems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, etc. should be sent\r\nto the address \"tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org\".
